# Frontend for ShipMonitoringSystem
The frontend was done with Angular, HTML, CSS, Typescript and a little bit of Bootstrap 5. The API was done by me, and it can be found [here](https://github.com/xpanderex/ShipMonitoringSystemBE)
#
The front end is only a view for the following task: "Define a view that returns ports from a specific country order by name"
